# Python Examples

This is a repository of example Python code for looking at and testing out the Python programming language.

As things are tried out more will get added.  The readme will attempt to be kept up-to-date. Each folder has
it's own little deals on what to look at, with their own virtual envs assumed.

## Examples

To run each example `cd` into the directory and run:

1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
3. Look at the readme in the folder on what to run

* dunder_new: classes with a __new__ method.
* context_managers: examples of using context managers.
* programming_patterns: examples of specific programming patterns.
